Survival Analysis of Lung Cancer Patients using Kaplan-Meier Estimators and Cox Proportional Hazards Models


## Project: Lung Cancer Survival Analysis
What I'm Investigating:
How long do patients typically survive after diagnosis?
Does biological sex significantly impact survival rates?

Statistical Techniques:
Kaplan-Meier Estimator: To estimate the survival function.
Log-Rank Test: To statistically compare the survival distributions of two groups.
Censoring Handling: Accounting for patients who were "lost to follow-up."
